# Angular 2 Starter Kit

Clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started. This is a bare bones starter kit to bootstrap any new ng2 application.

## Running the Application

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

2. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server.
